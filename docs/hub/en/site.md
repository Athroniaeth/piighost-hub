# The site

A Svelte application served by nginx, talking to the API under `/api/v1` from a
single origin. Eight routes, no server-side state, no accounts.

| Route | What you do there |
|---|---|
| `/` | the catalogue: search, sort, object list, tickable facets |
| `/r/:ns/:name[/:selector]` | one object: commit history on the left, the Content, Pipeline file and Use it tabs on the right |
| `/playground` | run an object or a candidate regex over a text |
| `/playground/compare` | two to four objects over the same text |
| `/playground/chat` | the whole round trip, with a scripted assistant |
| `/contribute` | write a pattern or a group, check it, open a pull request |
| `/labels` | every label the registry can emit, from the footer |
| `/stats` | how the registry is used, from counters aggregated to the hour |

## Structure, after the LangSmith Hub

The layout follows the [LangSmith Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub), which
distributes prompts as this site distributes configurations, and whose gestures
`piighost`'s visitors already know.

- **A breadcrumb bar, not a navbar.** The mark, then the page's place in the
  registry, `piighost / fr-default`. On the right, the two things a visitor
  does, the playground and contributing, then GitHub, the theme and the
  language.
- **A centred title and a pill search.** The home page is the catalogue: a
  title, one line, a wide search field, and the list immediately.
- **Sort chips.** Widest coverage, relevance, recently updated, most used, name.
  With no query the default is coverage: someone arriving without typing
  anything is looking for what covers the most, not for what a maintainer
  touched last. As soon as a query is typed, relevance takes over.
- **A vertical list, not a grid.** Each row leads with its pills (the kind, then
  the tags), the reference as the title, the description over two lines, then a
  metadata line: update date, number of labels, of commits and of uses. A "Try
  it" button on the right opens the playground with the object loaded.
- **Tickable facets with counts**, in a column on the right, grouped by family:
  type, region, category, domain, use case, language. The families come from the
  vocabulary's `kind`; manifest authors never see them.
- **A two column object page.** On the left, the commit history, each card
  carrying its hash, its pointer tags and its date. On the right, the shown
  commit with its pointers, then tabs: Content, Pipeline file, Use it. The title
  bar carries the reference, the pills and three actions: copy the reference,
  download, try it.

## The charter

The site takes `piighost-studio`'s charter so the ecosystem reads as one thing:
shadcn's neutral scale, a single violet primary, Geist for text and Geist Mono
for code and the wordmark, a 0.625rem base radius. Light is the default and dark
is a class on `<html>` set by the visitor, never inferred from the system, as the
studio does. The mark is piighost's placeholder reduced to a glyph, two chevrons
and the bar where the value used to be, defined once in `Wordmark`, which the
title, the breadcrumb and the footer share.

Fonts are self-hosted through `@fontsource-variable/geist`, the CSP allowing no
other origin. Icons come from lucide, one per import.

**Three surfaces, one grammar.** The playground, the comparison, the chat and the
contribution page are the same card in three numbered columns, Configure, Text,
Results, with an identical region header. The `Region` component carries that
grammar and the four pages import it.

**Contributing is a form.** A pattern, a group and a configuration each have
one; the configuration falls back to the TOML editor when it holds what the form
cannot write back, a detector with a model or a stage outside the three standard
ones, naming the piece in the way. Every example of a pattern carries its verdict
live, answered by the Python engine that will run it, because a browser cannot
answer that question honestly.

**A configuration is not contributed here.** A pattern and a group each have
their form; a configuration had one too, complete and tested, and it was taken
out. Assembling detectors and pipeline stages is a larger interface than a form,
and the intended path goes through a conversation rather than a grid of pickers.
The form that existed is kept at the git tag `config-form/v1`, whose message
lists the files to restore. The API still accepts a `config` submission.


**Entity colours are the studio's.** A palette of fifteen hues handed out by
first appearance, `PERSON` on the primary, carried verbatim from `labels.ts`. A
label therefore keeps the same colour in the hub and in the studio's playground.

**The components.** Under `components/ui/`: `Button`, `Badge`, `Card`,
`Segmented`, `Tabs`, `Region`, `StepChip`, `CodeBlock`, `CopyButton`. Above
them: `EntityLabel`, `EntityRow`, `EntityHighlight`, `ObjectCard`, `RefPicker`,
`SamplePicker`, `SiteNav`, `SiteFooter`. Native controls share their classes
from `lib/ui.ts` rather than a component per field.

## Choices that show

**Filters live in the URL.** A filtered view has to be shareable, and the back
button has to undo a filter rather than leave the page. The catalogue therefore
reads `q`, `kind`, `tag` (repeatable) and `label` from the query string, and has
no state of its own.

**Two languages, down to the manifests.** The registry is bilingual by
construction, every description carrying `en` and `fr`. The language switch also
writes `document.documentElement.lang`, which is where a screen reader takes its
voice from.

**No inline styles.** The production CSP allows `style-src 'self'` with no
`unsafe-inline`. Syntax highlighting that emitted `style="color:…"` would work in
development and break in production, so highlighting goes through classes and the
colours live in the stylesheet. The built bundle holds no `style` attribute.

**A printable page.** The `no-print` class removes the controls and the sheet
turns black on white. A data protection officer reads a coverage sheet on paper,
not a TOML file.

**A router in one file.** Eight routes, no nested layouts: a routing dependency
would cost more in indirection than it gives. nginx already serves `index.html`
as a fallback, which is all a history router needs. Links stay real `<a href>`,
so middle-click and open-in-a-tab work.

## What the playground does not do

Model detectors, GLiNER2 and spaCy, do not run: weights would have to be
downloaded and loaded on every request. A configuration carrying one is still
runnable, its regex detectors run, and the response names what was skipped in
`unsupported`. The object page says so too.

Running a model in the browser through Pyodide, as `piighost`'s own presentation
site does, remains the right answer eventually: the text would not leave the
machine, which is exactly the argument for a PII tool. That is an application in
its own right, not a checkbox here.
