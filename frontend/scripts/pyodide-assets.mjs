/**
 * Put Pyodide and the piighost wheel under `public/`, so the browser fetches
 * them from this origin.
 *
 * Not a convenience: the production Content-Security-Policy is `script-src
 * 'self'; connect-src 'self'`, which rules out Pyodide's CDN and rules out
 * micropip reaching PyPI. Everything the worker loads has to be served by us,
 * which also means a visitor who presses the test button gets a fixed version
 * rather than whatever PyPI resolves to that day.
 *
 * The wheel is downloaded rather than committed: 162 KB of build output does
 * not belong in the history, and the version is pinned here.
