/**
 * What the site reports to a self-hosted OpenPanel, and nothing else.
 *
 * The event set is closed on purpose. Every property here is a shape, a count
 * or a duration; none of them can carry a text a visitor typed, a value a
 * pattern detected or a span of either. The site tells anyone who reads the
 * playground that their text is never written to a database, and analytics that
 * quietly broke that promise would be worse than no analytics. Adding a key
 * that could carry one means changing this type, in a diff someone reads.
 *
 * The SDK is bundled rather than loaded from openpanel.dev, and the events go
 * to a same-origin path that nginx forwards. Two things follow: the
 * Content-Security-Policy stays `script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'`, which
 * is a property of this deployment worth keeping, and an ad blocker that drops
 * requests to openpanel.dev has nothing to drop, so the numbers are not quietly
 * missing whichever share of visitors runs one.
