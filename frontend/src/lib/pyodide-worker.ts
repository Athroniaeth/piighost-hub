/**
 * piighost's regex pipeline, running in the visitor's own tab.
 *
 * The playground sends its text to the API, which is honest about not storing
 * it but is still a promise rather than a property. Here the text does not
 * leave: Pyodide loads the real `piighost` wheel, which is pure Python and
 * needs only `typing-extensions` at its core, and the same `RegexDetector` and
 * `ConfidenceOverlapResolver` the registry's own checks use do the work.
 *
 * Running it faithfully is the whole point, and it rules out the obvious
 * shortcut. These patterns are Python `re` compiled with `re.ASCII`: JavaScript
 * disagrees on lookbehind, on what `\w` covers and on how a quantifier
 * backtracks, so a regex engine that is merely similar would report detections
 * the registry does not make.
 *
 * In a worker because loading Pyodide takes seconds and a hostile pattern can
 * take longer still; neither may hold the page.
