"""The hub's traffic, forwarded to a self-hosted OpenPanel.

Two things use this hub and only one of them has a browser. The site is
instrumented from the page, where OpenPanel can see a device and a session and
answer the questions a dashboard is for. `piighost hub pull` is a command line
tool: nothing there loads a script, so the only place its calls can be observed
is here, on the way out of the API.

So this forwards exactly the calls the browser cannot speak for, and nothing
else. A request from a browser is skipped, because the page already sent its
own event and counting it twice would make every number on the dashboard wrong
in a way that looks plausible.

What is sent is the shape of the call and nothing more: the kind, the registry
object it named, whether the reference was pinned, and the status. The caller's
address and user agent are deliberately not forwarded, though OpenPanel accepts
both and would geolocate with them, because the promise the site makes about
the playground is worth more than a map. `backend/hub/usage.py` explains the
same reasoning for the counters kept on disk.

Sending happens on a bounded queue drained by a worker. A slow or unreachable
dashboard must never delay an answer to a caller, and never fail one: when the
queue is full an event is dropped, which is the correct trade for telemetry.
