"""How the hub is used, counted rather than logged.

The site promises that a text sent to the playground is never written to a
database. Analytics that broke that promise would be worse than no analytics, so
this is not a request log with the fields trimmed off. It is a table of counters,
and the difference is structural rather than a matter of discipline:

- The finest resolution is the hour. There is no row that corresponds to one
  request, so there is nothing to correlate.
- The only columns are the shape of the call: what kind it was, which registry
  object it named, whether the reference was pinned, whether the caller was a
  browser or the library, and the status. No address, no user agent string, no
  session, no body, ever.
- Writes are `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET count = count + 1`, so two
  identical calls in the same hour are indistinguishable by construction.

What it answers is the question that prompted it: which configurations do people
actually pull through `piighost hub pull`, pinned or floating, and does that
change over time. What it cannot answer is who did it, which is the point.

Counting happens in memory and is flushed on a timer, so the hot path is a
dictionary increment and a slow disk never delays a response.
