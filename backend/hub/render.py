    A config names several regex detectors because that is how its sources are
    kept apart in the registry: one per group, so a child can exclude one by
    name and the composition check can replay them in order. None of that
    survives rendering — the flattened form keeps the type and the patterns and
    nothing else — so three ``[[detector.detectors]]`` blocks reading
    ``type = 'regex'`` were three ways of writing one.

    Merging is safe because a regex detector emits one detection per pattern in
    the order its mapping was built, and a composite concatenates its
    detectors' detections in order, so the concatenation of the three is the
    single mapping built in the same order. Verified over the registry: every
    config, every pattern example and every sample, identical spans and labels.

    Two limits keep that true. Only *neighbours* merge, because a detector of
    another kind between two regex ones is a step in the order. And a label
    carried twice with two different regexes blocks the merge, since one
    mapping cannot hold both and the second would silently win.
