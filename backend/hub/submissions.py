"""Check a manifest a visitor wrote, and turn it into a pull request.

The registry is git-first, so publishing is a pull request, not a write
endpoint. That is not a limitation to work around: a config ships into other
people's pipelines, review is the trust boundary, and git already enforces
authorship, history and reverts. What the site adds is the part a contributor
cannot do alone, running the real checks before the pull request exists, so a
review argues about the pattern rather than about a missing example.
