"""robots.txt, sitemap.xml and llms.txt, all generated from the registry.

Two things stand between a registry object and someone finding it: a crawler
has to be allowed in, and it has to be told the page exists. The site is a
single page application, so no link on it survives without JavaScript, which
makes the sitemap the only reliable way a search engine learns that
`/r/piighost/fr-default` is a page at all.

Both are generated rather than written by hand, for the same reason the site
is: the registry grows, and a list of 218 URLs maintained by a human is a list
of 180 URLs three weeks later. They sit at the site root rather than under
`/api`, because that is where a crawler looks, and nginx proxies the two exact
paths through.
